<h3>Green Book</h3>
        <p>In 1962, tough bouncer Frank "Tony Lip" Vallelonga searches for work while his nightclub is closed for renovations. 
        The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for African-American classical pianist Don Shirley for a concert tour into 
        the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a Black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin their trek armed with 
        hr"The Negro Motorist Green Book," a guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. The snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely 
        practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure 
        America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, 
        they nurture an understanding and a friendship that would change both their lives.</p>
